# CLEAN (Collect Logistics Efficient and Notification)

This project basically helps inform Municipal Corporation about any spilled garbage in any part of the city. This is a web-based application that will act as a portal for users to register or log in to the site, upload garbage photos, give complaints or feedback. 
The Municipal Corporation will be the admin who will be handling all the user requests and queries. The user has to register on the site after which he will receive the auto-generated password in his provided email. That email and password can be used by the user to login into the portal. If the user wants to inform the Municipal Corporation about the garbage at a particular location, then he has to click the photo of that garbage and upload that photo through the portal. 
The portal is smart enough to detect the garbage from the uploaded photos. The user will be able to see the accuracy of the garbage present in the uploaded photo. If the accuracy is beyond a certain value, then the system will automatically send the email notification to the respective areaâ€™s staff head along with the garbage photo and its location. 
Hence this our portal will help the user to directly interact with the Municipal Corporation to clean the garbage present on the streets. Moreover, the user can also raise a complaint through our portal and can also provide ratings and feedback.

The project is developed in Python using the Flask framework. The Santa Not Santa dataset was useful to train the model for image classification.
